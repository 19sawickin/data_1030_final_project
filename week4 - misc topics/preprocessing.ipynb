    "- **can we work on time series data for the project?**\n",
    "    - yes, in fact you are encouraged to work with non-iid datasets\n",
    "    - that's how you learn the most in this class\n",
    "- **Can the autocorrelation plot help you pick an optimal lag period to use?**\n",
    "    - it might give you an idea but you really need to measure the generalization error as a function of the number of lag-shifted features to come up with an answer\n",
    "- **\"What is the proper lag-step and number of features for different scenarios?**\n",
    "    - as I said in class, there is no magic number that works for all cases\n",
    "    - measure how the generalization error changes as a function of the number of lag-shifted features \n",
    "    - that plot will give you an answer, but that answer will be specific to your project\n",
    "- **I'm still unsure about how to prevent info leak in time series, doesn't all future data contain info from the past?**\n",
    "    - the point is to not use future data to predict the past\n",
    "    - this might seem obvious but it is one of those mistakes that are easy to make because your code will not produce an error message\n",
    "- **Why does introducing lag features make the feature matrix iid?**\n",
    "    - it doesn't\n",
    "    - maybe you have an earlier version of the lecture notes, I made some changes on tuesday morning\n",
    "    - check out the current version\n",
    "- **I am still very unclear about what the \"lag\" is or how the \"shifting\" results in iid data.**\n",
    "    - shifting does not result in iid data\n",
    "    - maybe you also have access to the earlier version of the lecture notes\n",
    "- **Why the autocorrelation plot decreases so smoothly in this pattern?**\n",
    "- **can you explain the autocorrelation figure? why with the increasing lag, the correlation coefficienct convergent to 0**\n",
    "    - check the code in the previous lecture\n",
    "    - the autocorrelation coefficient has two terms: the Pearson correlation coefficient multiplied by the fraction of the dataset used\n",
    "    - that second term approaches 0 as the leg increases\n",
    "    - it is 1 for 0 leg, and 0 for the maximum lag you can calculate based on your dataset\n",
    "- **Why do we have to make time lags for the weather data to predict future outcomes? Why cant we just take every other day and put in training set, and the remaining go in testing - or something similar with a not 50/50 split?**\n",
    "    - because one time series measurement does not give you a feature matrix and a target variable\n",
    "    - you need to transform it\n",
    "    - you can't do a simple train_test_split because time series datasets are not iid\n",
    "- **For time series, is the number of features inversely correlated with the number of observations for each one?**\n",
    "    - Linearly correlated\n",
    "    - if you have more observations, the maxmimum number of lag-shifted features you can create goes up\n",
    "- **Why do we use autocorrelation and autoregression?**\n",
    "    - to study and work with time series data\n",
    "- **If your target variable is very far off in the future. How do you test for the accuracy of your prediction when you only have data form the past?**\n",
    "    - you usually predict near future stuff\n",
    "    - predictive power far in the future is usually pretty bad otherwise ML would be much widely used\n",
    "- **For the wrist-band hospital model, would more of the same kind of data allow us to build a better model?**\n",
    "    - that's the hope, yes\n",
    "    - it is not guaranteed though\n",
    "    - the conclusion of the paper was that there might be something promising here but we will need more data to verify\n",
    "- **What is the best way to balance group splitting and stratified splitting? For example, if a class shows up in only one group, we may train models that do not ever see that class in training, but we also dont want to split the group. Is there a compromise between these two factors?**\n",
    "    - good question!\n",
    "    - I think it depends on how many grops you have\n",
    "    - if you have many groups, this is not a problem because you will have multiple groups in each set\n",
    "    - if you only have a limited number of groups, it might happen that your validation and/or test set will only contain that group and it will be difficult to assess the generalization error\n",
    "- **So when making features for time-series data, these are all just lags?**\n",
    "    - that's the basic idea, yes\n",
    "    - you can add moving averages instead of the feature values\n",
    "    - but generally lag shifting is what you do with time series data in ML\n",
    "- **Do we just have one column of data (but being shifted differently into different columns) for autoregression?**\n",
    "    - yep\n",
    "    - you might have multiple time series observations, e.g., you might want to predict the S&P 500 price using the Tesla, Meta, and Amazon prices. You would need to shift all three price feeds to generate features\n",
    "- **What does the term \"data-leakage\" mean exactly?**\n",
    "    - it means that you use information during model development that will not be available to you when the model is deployed\n",
    "    - as a result, your model gives a great test score (generalization error), but it will perform poorly when it is deployed\n",
    "- **When should you use auto correlation? It intuitively feel like past values might negatively influence the prediction. Unless something is very predictable like temperature or weekly purchases, I feel like taking in account of past prices could be bad. It feels weird like cofounding variables.**\n",
    "    - using the past data to predict the future is perfectly fine\n",
    "    - that's mostly what people use to predict any sort of price movements\n",
    "    - what other info would you use as features?\n",
    "- **For predicting time series data, can we use an ARIMA model?**\n",
    "    - no, stick to autoregressive features and apply the ML models we will cover in a few weeks during class\n",
    "- **What would be a more intuitive way to understand these segmented bar charts for GroupShuffleSplit, GroupKFold, etc.? Currently not sure how the colored bars link to the concept**\n",
    "    - read the manuals on the sklearn website\n",
    "    - they provide longer explanations and more examples\n",
    "- **Is it worthwhile to see how a target variable correlates to a lag of different features you have?**\n",
    "    - if those other features are time series of other observations, yes\n",
    "    - you only lag-shift time series observations\n",
    "- **\"I only have a vague understanding on the underlying purpose of using lags on time-series data, could you give some further explanation?**\n",
    "    - check the sklearn website for more explanations and examples [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit.html)\n",
    "- **For the varieties of auto-regression that would show up in technical interviews, how deep should we know about it? Should we know how to actually imply them or to be able to explain the mechanism is fine?**\n",
    "    - the more you know, the better\n",
    "- **I am generally confused about the topic of autoregression and why one reorients features. Is it solely due based on time, or is there other considerations?**\n",
    "    - yes, you would apply autoregression on time series data only\n",
    "- **It would be helpful to fully walk through a time series analysis. What model would we use to predict the target variable? How do we measure the accuracy of our model as we try to predict more distant target variables?**\n",
    "    - once the features are generated via autoregression, the rest of the steps are the same as for an iid or any other dataset\n",
    "    - we will cover all of these topics in the coming weeks\n",
    "- **I think I became more confused with the concept of K-fold and n_splits. Is there a really helpful crash course video that you would recommend in addition to watching the lecture over again?**\n",
    "    - check out the sklearn website for more examples and more explanation\n",
    "- **Could you explain more about the GroupKFold?**\n",
    "    - I won't have time but check out the sklearn website for more info\n",
    "- **And also for the part of time series, will we learn more about it? (like ARMA, SARIMA in this class)**\n",
    "    - no, we won't cover more in this class, I just gave you the big picture overview and idea\n",
    "    - but i do recommend you read more about those techniques\n",
    "- **I am unclear how you calculate the confidence interval in the autocorrelation plot.**\n",
    "    - pandas calculates it for you\n",
    "    - check the pandas manual for an explanation\n",
    "- **If there are non-time series features combined with time-series features, how do we train the model? Do we train the time-series \"lag features\" first, then we modify the model based on non-time series features? Training all the features at the same time does not seem feasible to me.**\n",
    "    - it is feasable, you simply need to merge the time series features with the non-time series features\n",
    "- **What are the advantages of group-based split instead of a Group Shuffle Split? When exactly we should choose one instead of the other?**\n",
    "- **Would you be able to clarify we should use¬† GroupKFold vs GroupShuffleFold?**\n",
    "    - both are fine\n",
    "    - I'm giving you multiple tools to solve the same problem\n",
    "    - I have a small personal preference for GroupKFold but that's subjective\n",
    "- **Im still unclear what the main advantage/use of doing autocorrelation and lag would be? Is it exclusive for timeseries data?**\n",
    "    - yes it is\n",
    "- **Will we have much time series data?**\n",
    "    - you can use a time series prediction for your project\n",
    "    - and it is almost certain that you will come across time series data in your career at some point\n",
    "- **What do you do with uncorrelated time series data?**\n",
    "    - good question\n",
    "    - I have not seen uncorrelated time series data\n",
    "    - if the autocorrelation plot is flat with a correlation coefficient 0, it means you should not create autoregressive features, you need to collect some other features for prediction\n",
    "- **What does it mean for data to be iid, or not iid, and why do other correlations not count as violating iid data?**\n",
    "    - iid vs non-iid is about how the data is generated, it is not about correlations between the features and the target variable\n",
    "- **Very muddy about the time series scenarios and why we even need to use machine learning for those types of problems. You're just calculating everything out no?**\n",
    "    - what do you mean by 'calculating everything out'?\n",
    "- **What is the purpose of the Pearson coefficient ?**\n",
    "    - check out [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient)\n",
    "- **Sorry that this is a basic question: I'm a bit confused -- in a groupKfolds split, does each group get put in a fold by itself? How does that differentiate conceptually from GroupShuffleSplit?**\n",
    "    - yes, in groupkfold, each group gets put in a fold by itself, so each group appears only once in the validation set\n",
    "    - in groupshufflesplit, the groups in the validation are determined randomly, so the same group can be put in the validation set multiple times\n",
    "- **I want to more practice during the class!**\n",
    "    - me too but there is no time\n",
    "    - you need to practice outside of class"
