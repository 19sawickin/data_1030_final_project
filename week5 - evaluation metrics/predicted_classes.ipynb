    "- **should you ever remove a feature ? Or will it always be beneficial. I like to drop columns where 80% of the values are empty.**\n",
    "    - I'd only drop unique IDs like the ID column in the house price dataset\n",
    "    - I wouldn't drop a feature if 80% of values are empty\n",
    "    - that remaining 20% could be helpful or the missingness might correlated with the target variable somehow\n",
    "        - e.g. in classification, 90% of missing values are in class 0, and 10% are in class 1\n",
    "        - e.g., in regression, the probability of a value missing correlates with the target variable (if the target variable is large, it is more likely the feature will be missing)\n",
    "        - some ML techniques can learn these sort of things to improve predictive power\n",
    "- **For continuous feature, can we use random number (which follows the distribution of existing values) to fill the missing values?**\n",
    "    - I wouldn't \n",
    "    - let's assume the feature is some sort of test result which is performed on some patients but it is unnecessary for other patiens like measuring the concentration of certain platelets\n",
    "    - would you feel comfortable randomly guessing what the platelet count is for patients without test?\n",
    "- **Can you preform feature engineering on your target variable in order to create a new category for prediction?**\n",
    "    - NO!!!\n",
    "    - absolutely not\n",
    "    - when you deploy the model and it is time to use it on previously unseen data, how would you determine that new category without knowing the target variable?\n",
    "    - this would be a very bad case of information leakage\n",
    "- **What is the difference between the feature selection approaches we covered at the end of class and using 'Stepwise regression' to identify informative features? Is the latter less flexible or useful in some cases?**\n",
    "    - stepwise regression/classification is more powerful because you use an ML model to select features so feature interactions can be taken into account\n",
    "    - the f test and the mutual info calculates how strongly each feature correlates with the target variable but it ignores feature interactions\n",
    "    - we will cover a couple of techniques to select features using ML models like permutation feature importance, shap, Lasso or l1 regularization\n",
    "- **\"I am confused as to why the polynomialFeatures is useful, is it random added data?**\n",
    "- **I understand why creating a feature like a x b is useful for capturing feature interactions, but what is the point of polynomial features like a^2, b^2, if already have a and b.**\n",
    "    - if you use a linear model and sqrt(a) + noise = y, model performance will improve if you add a^2 because now a^2 and y will be linearly correlated\n",
    "    - these are very handwavy arguments\n",
    "    - as I said in class, automated feature engineering is rarely useful\n",
    "- **Conceptually, the idea of transformations doesn't seem to add any new information to me but maybe that's because I don't understand how the algorithms fail to make those calculations on their own.**\n",
    "    - you are correct, transformations don't add new info\n",
    "    - it will help the ML model to converge faster though\n",
    "    - read more [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/all-about-feature-scaling-bcc0ad75cb35)\n",
    "- **Near the beginning of lecture when we talked about transforming the categorical, nominal, and numeric columns, I am confused on how we know what preprocessor.fit_transform and preprocessor.get_feature_names_out do**\n",
    "    - check their manuals\n",
    "- **If there is a relationship between more than 2 features, how will we find out because it is difficult to visualize data in higher dimensions.**\n",
    "    - yes, that's difficult\n",
    "    - you can maybe visualize three features in 3D but it's tough to go beyond that\n",
    "- **will adding more features ever make the model worse?**\n",
    "    - good question!\n",
    "    - depends on the model\n",
    "    - tree-based methods will not get worse if you add uninformative features but k nearest neightbors will\n",
    "    - once we cover ML algorithms, you could create a toy dataset, add uninformative features and study this effect\n",
    "- **If the feature selection that we covered today happens before data splitting, why are you teaching it after data splitting? I guess it is because it is a relatively not-important topic?**\n",
    "    - yeah\n",
    "    - automated feature engineering and feature selection without an ML model are short topics you might or might not need in the future\n",
    "    - it doesn't hurt to at least hear about them but they are not really all that useful in practice\n",
    "- **if the degree were to increase, is it just like multiplying everything out as if it were algebra? so three integers its a*a*a but two degrees is just a*a and would there still be a*a in 3 degrees?**\n",
    "    - run the code and check it yourself! :)\n",
    "- **Do time series data require feature engineering?**\n",
    "    - yes, autoregression is basically feature engineering for time series data\n",
    "- **Could more advanced statistical methods be applied to the dataset and then added as a new feature? Or should we stick to basic calculations for the new features?**\n",
    "    - you can create any feature you'd like\n",
    "- **As mentioned in class, we are doing feature engineering after we choose a model. How do we know what is the best feature-model combo? What if the feature we engineered can achieve better performance on other models?**\n",
    "    - always check the generalization error, the test score\n",
    "    - it is a good idea to engineer one feature and run it through multiple models and check which model is the best\n",
    "- **I understand the value of adding features and not preemptively taking them out before modelling. However, doesn't adding too many features also run the risk of overfitting and making the model less generalizable to datasets that aren't coded exactly the same way?**\n",
    "    - overfitting is avoided with cross-validation and measuring the bias-variance trade-off\n",
    "    - classical supervised ML models almost never generalize to other datasets/projects\n",
    "    - your model will be specific to the dataset you trained it on\n",
    "- **Would feature engineering also entail filling in missing values based on other datasets. For example, if we had weather data, could we use the weather from the year prior to help fill in values?**\n",
    "    - no, it's not feature engineering because you don't create a new feature\n",
    "    - and no, I wouldn't use values from a year ago to fill in the dataset\n",
    "    - generally I'm not a big fan of imputation\n",
    "    - I'll cover one state of the art imputation technique that I'm OK with if used properly\n",
    "    - and I'll show two methods to handle missing values without imputation\n",
    "- **How does training a machine learning model before doing feature selection help in identifying feature interactions?**\n",
    "    - we will learn about feature importance metrics that can measure how important feature pairs are at predicting the target variable\n",
    "- **Do data reduction techniques fall under the category of feature engineering?**\n",
    "    - no, that's feature selection\n",
    "- **Is multivariate imputation only used for continuous variables?**\n",
    "    - yep\n",
    "    - you can preprocess missing values in categorical and ordinal features easily without imputation\n",
    "- **Do we have to plot the relationships between every combination of two features to make sure we did not miss any feature interactions?**\n",
    "    - yes, alternatively see PS5, problem 3\n",
    "- **Will we need to do feature selection in our projects?**\n",
    "    - up to you"
